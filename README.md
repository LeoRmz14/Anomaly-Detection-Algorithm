# Anomaly Detection Algorithm
This repository contains a Gaussian Model for Anomaly Detection. It was developed as part of the course *Unsupervised Learning: Recommender Systems and Reinforcement Learning* thought in *Coursera* by *DeepLearning.AI* and the *Standford University*. Some of the parts were part of a laboratory task, however the code was enhaced with additional explanations and documentation as well as functions that complement the overal objective: *detection of anomalous behavior on data points*.

> For extra documentation about the functions used visit the **Wiki** page on this repository.
